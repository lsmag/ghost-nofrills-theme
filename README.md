# Ghost "nofrills" theme

A super simple Ghost theme based mostly on [BetterMotherfuckingWebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/),
so yeah, it looks like a web 1.0 page, with just enough CSS not to look so hideous. And I like it :)

The theme *does not support* a lot of features Ghost offers, like analytics, comments through Disqus,
social share links and etc.. I don't want these things, so I didn't implement them. If you want them
you should look at [Odin](https://github.com/h4t0n/odin), which this theme is based on
(seriously, thanks folks, your code is awesome).

You can see this theme in my personal blog, [blog.lsmagalhaes.com](https://blog.lsmagalhaes.com).
